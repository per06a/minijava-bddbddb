Take a look at the link:http://bddbddb.sourceforge.net/[bddbddb] project for
access to conference papers and source code.  Unfortunately, the
documentation seems to be a bit sparse.  This guide describes how to write a
very basic set of constraints in datalog and solve the system using bddbddb.

Datalog Description
-------------------

The following is a datalog description of set intersection.  The domain
contains small integers.  Input are two sets of numbers: `X` and `Y`.  The
output will be a set named `Intersection`.  A single rule is used to place
elements from both `X` and `Y` into `Intersection` called
`intersection.txt`:

----
# Domains
G 256


# Relations

# Input sets to intersect
X (a:G) inputtuples
Y (b:G) inputtuples

# Output of "X intersect Y"
Intersection (i:G) output


# Rules
Intersection (i) :- X(i), Y(i).
----


Constraint Files
----------------

The data log file notes that `X` and `Y` and `inputtuples`.  Input tuple
files have a simple format with one column for each member of the relation.
The file name corresponds with the relation name and ends in "tuples".  For
this example we use `X.tuples`:

----
# G0:256
1
2
3
4
5
6
----

and `Y.tuples`:

----
# G0:256
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
----

Note the magic numbering at the top of the file.  We note that members in a
tuples file are from domain G.  Since a tuples file may have multiple
members from a domain, each occurrence of a domain is numbered starting with
zero.


Solving Constraints
-------------------

Grab the bddbddb jar file and then:

----
java -jar ../bddbddb-full.jar intersection.txt
----

This generates `rbddinfo` and `Intersection.bdd`.  The name of the main
output file `Intersection.bdd` is derived from the name of the output
specified in the datalog file: `Intersection`.  Since the specification uses
`output` the generated output file is in a bdd format with the extension
`bdd`.


Getting Data Out of bdd Files
-----------------------------

The bdd representation is not easy to read by hand.  Actually, I'm not yet
sure how to read it by hand.  So data must be extracted from it.  The
following datalog program is a simple pass through filter that dumps a bdd
file with a single field to a tuple file called `dump.txt`:

----
# Domains
G 256

# This is a comment

Intersection (i:G) input
Dump (o:G) outputtuples

# Rules 
Dump (x) :- Intersection (x).
---- 

Execute:

----
java -jar ../bddbddb-full.jar dump.txt
----

This generates `Dump.tuples`.  Note that this time we specified
`outputtuples` rather than `output`.  This additional filtering step is
recommended since, for more complex programs, the bdd file can describe a
huge number of tuples in a small space.  Rather than dumping all of these to
tuple output, it is a good idea to filter out only the results you are
interested.
