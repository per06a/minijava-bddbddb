The "easiest" way to get the JavaCC project is to check it out with CVS.

File -> New -> Project -> CVS -> Checkout Project From CVS

Then enter the following fields:
Server = cvs.dev.java.net
Path = /cvs
Username = your_user_name
Password = your_password

Then click Next, and Select a Module. It will probably take a while to load them all.
Select the javacc module, and check it out.

Then add the following to your shell setup (Unix):
JAVACC_HOME=<some_path_to>/javacc
JAVACC_PATH=$JAVACC_HOME/bin

It's the same in Windows, but you need to add it to the environment variables.
